Scrabbletool is a practicing tool for scrabble-like games. Currently it's functionality is limited to finding hooks to words given a certain wordlist. For testing purposes a flat (=one word on each row) testing wordlist of about 20 words has been included.  
Scrabbletool is not intended as a standalone application but rather a sub-component in a larger system, for example toghether with a webserver et.c. Scrabbletool is programmed in Erlang and thus requires an installation it to run. It has currently only been tested with Release 15B. It's in early development.
